# Image Sampling

Image sampling samples still images from a camera stream. This is one of the fundamental ways for collecting dataset that will later be used in training machine learning models. This also gives a guidance on how an inferencing was performed -- an image taken approximately at the same time when the inference was performed (on the same scene) visually shows what the context was.
